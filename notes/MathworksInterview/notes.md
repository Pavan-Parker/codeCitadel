# Embedded Coder

- Two setups are possible
  - I/O mode
    - Env will be in host Computer itself which interacts with the target to execute the commands.
    - Debugging mode.
  - Deployment Mode
    - The env will be in target itself.
    - Release Mode.

Are there any plans to tweak the OS configuration itself? to make it minimal.
