an RTOS needs to meet a 

- certain hard deadline
- with a given accuracy
- and always reliable

In the Image above, leftmost is a hardware specific simple system. Middle one contains OS which can be used for devices by multiple vendors. This can be done using HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layers) which gives pushes all the vendor specific details under the hood to make software programmer's life easy. The right most system has more cores which gives more computing power that comes with more complex concepts like synchronization, communication and assigning tasks across the cores.

> We can see that as we go from left to right, the role of OS is becoming more important.

# Computer Architecture

| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| __The above set of questions defines the architecture.__     |

## Architecture Overview

Four major components of this architecture are

- BIU (Bus interface Units)
  - BIU drives the address bus drives the bus and itâ€™s control signals, which specifies the timing, size and direction of the transfer.
  - EAR (Effective Address Register) has the memory address from the data is to be fetched from. 
- CU (Control Unit)
  - CU orchestrates the sequence of the operations and commands all the other 3. components.
  - IR (Instruction Register) contains the opcode for the current instruction. For thumb-2, it maybe 16 bit or 32 bit.
- ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
- Registers

A micro-controller contains all of processor, memory and I/O on a single chip.

In an embedded system, the software is converted into machine code, which is list of instructions stored in non-volatile flash ROM. These instructions are fetched and put in a pipeline. In cortex-m, the instructions are executed in-order (Means all instructions are fetched, executed and written-back in same order as compiled), however it can execute the current and fetch the next.

| Cortex-M architecture                                        |

>Cortex-M has **Harvard architecture** as it has separate buses for data (System Bus) and instructions (ICode bus). It also has a DCode bus for debugging purposes.

An **interrupt** is a response by processor to an event triggered which needs an immediate attention. Components like Nested Vector Interrupt Controller (NVIC) which directly communicates with the processor via Private Peripheral Bus (PPB), helps with lower latencies of the interrupt.

## Memory

| Micro-controller | Clock Speed | Flash ROM | SRAM  |
| :--------------: | ----------- | --------- | ----- |
|     TM4C123      | 80MHz       | 256kiB    | 32kiB |
|      MSP432      | 48MHz       | 256kiB    | 64kiB |

For TM4C123 and MSP432, 32 address line are present, hence the 32 bit address space, which is divided as following.

>In general, All the beginning addresses of the regions are same, as given below, but the ending addresses depends on the specific member.
>
>- Flash ROM begins from 0x0000.0000
>- RAM from 0x2000.0000
>- I/O from 0x4000.0000
>- Private I/O from 0xE000.0000
## Buses

Having multiple buses helps processor perform multiple tasks at the same time. Some of those tasks are 

- **ICode bus** - fetch opcode from ROM.
- **DCode bus** - read constant data from ROM.
- **System bus** - read/write data from RAM or I/O, fetch opcode from RAM. 
- **PPB (Private Peripheral Bus)** - read/write data from internal peripherals like NVIC.
- **AHPB (Advanced High Performance Bus)** - read/write data from internal peripherals like USB.

> The items that can change over the time (The Heap,The Stack and Variables), go in the RAM and which do not (Instruction Code and Constants), go in the ROM.  

## Registers
![registers](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/1e0bbbb43f4ab3cf696535e7e8c06059/asset-v1:UTAustinX+UT.RTBN.12.01x+3T2019+type@asset+block/Fig01_07_registers.jpg)

The image above depicts the registers in ARM Cortex-M processor.

- R0-15, all are of 32-bit width.
  - Registers R0 to R12 are General Purpose registers.
  - R13 is a stack pointer points to the top of the stack.
    - Actually, there are two stack pointers of which only one will be active at a time. One is MSP (Main Stack Pointer) used for OS code and the other is PSP (Process Stack Pointer) used for User Code. This seperation helps OS from crashing when user code crashes. 
  - R14 is a Link pointer which contains the pointer to the return location from a subroutine call.
  - R15 is a Program counter, which points to the address of the next instruction to be fetched from the memory. So that the processor fetches the address in PC and increments it.
- PSR holds the information about flags set by the operation, like NZVC bits, Thumb bit and ISR number.
![PSR](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/1de71c785578c22878cb866793ff0dc5/asset-v1:UTAustinX+UT.RTBN.12.01x+3T2019+type@asset+block/Fig01_08_statusregister.jpg)
  - NZVCQ bits signifies the status of the previous ALU operation that signifies the result of it.
    - N = Negative
    - Z = Zero
    - V = Overflow
    - C = Carry
    - Q = Sticky Saturation
    - T = Thumb Instruction
    - ICI/IT = IF-THEN flags
- if PRIMASK is set to 0, the interrupts are enabled else most are not.
- Base Priority says the priority of the executing software. It allows only interrupts lower than this value to execute. 

>The ARM Architecture Procedure Call Standard, AAPCS, part of the ARM Application Binary Interface (ABI), uses registers R0, R1, R2, and R3 to pass input parameters into a C function or an assembly subroutine. Also according to AAPCS we place the return parameter in Register R0. The standard requires functions to preserve the contents of R4-R11. In other words, functions save R4-R11, use R4-R11, and then restore R4-R11 before returning.
